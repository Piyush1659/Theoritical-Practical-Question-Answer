        "\n",
        "It's a really good observation that NumPy’s array slicing is faster than slicing a standard Python list. Here’s why:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Contiguous memory layout:\n",
        "NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, typically in C-like row-major format. This means accessing a range of elements involves accessing memory in a single, cache-friendly stride — much faster for the CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python lists, by contrast, are arrays of pointers to arbitrary PyObjects. This introduces additional indirection and poor cache locality when accessing elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. View instead of copy:\n",
        "When you slice a NumPy array, you get a view into the original array’s data. This means slicing is an O(1) operation — it simply manipulates metadata (like shape, stride, and offset) instead of allocating new memory or copying the elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python’s list slicing always creates a new list and copies elements, which is O(k) — where k is the number of elements in the slice. This further adds a significant performance cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Implemented in C:\n",
        "NumPy’s core routines are implemented in C (and often leverage SIMD instructions), which lets them perform operations much faster than pure-Python code. List slicing runs through a Python bytecode loop, adding additional overhead."
