Essentially, it's a flowchart-like structure that helps make decisions based on the values of input features.\n",

Decision tree algorithms use these measures to determine the best way to split nodes, aiming to create more homogeneous child nodes at each step.

It quantifies the reduction in uncertainty (or entropy) about the target variable achieved by splitting the data based on a particular feature. Features with higher information gain are considered more informative and are chosen for splitting the tree, leading to more accurate predictions."

While both aim to minimize impurity (or maximize purity) in the resulting child nodes, they differ in their calculation and sensitivity to class distribution.
