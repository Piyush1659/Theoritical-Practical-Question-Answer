        "\n",
        ">- In Logistic Regression, different solvers refer to the optimization algorithms used to find the best model parameters. The choice of solver depends on the size and characteristics of your dataset, particularly the number of samples and features, as well as your specific needs for computational efficiency, accuracy, and regularization. Here are some common solvers and when they might be appropriate:\n",
        "\n",
        "    liblinear:\n",
        "    \n",
        "This solver is efficient for small datasets and is particularly suitable for binary classification problems. It uses a coordinate descent algorithm and can handle various regularization types. However, it's limited to one-versus-rest (OvR) multiclass classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "    lbfgs (Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno):\n",
        "\n",
        "This solver is a good choice for medium-sized datasets. It's an iterative optimization algorithm that approximates the Hessian matrix efficiently, making it faster than Newton's methods for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "    sag (Stochastic Average Gradient):\n",
        "\n",
        "This solver is designed for large datasets. It uses stochastic gradient descent, which updates the parameters based on a random subset of the data at each iteration. This makes it computationally efficient for large datasets. However, it may not converge as quickly as other solvers for smaller datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "    saga (Stochastic Average Gradient with Averaging):\n",
        "\n",
        "This solver is an improvement over sag. It also uses stochastic gradient descent but incorporates an averaging mechanism to reduce variance and improve convergence, especially when dealing with large datasets and high-dimensional data. It supports L1 regularization, unlike sag.\n",
        "\n",
        "    newton-cg (Newton's Method with Conjugate Gradient):\n",
        "\n",
        "This solver uses Newton's method, which involves computing the Hessian matrix. While it can be very accurate, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets, especially with many features. It is more suitable for smaller datasets or problems where high accuracy is critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "    newton-cholesky:\n",
        "\n",
        "This solver is a variant of newton-cg. It's optimized for datasets where the number of samples is significantly larger than the number of features. It takes advantage of the structure of the Hessian matrix to achieve faster convergence in these specific scenarios.\n",

        "For small datasets: liblinear is often a good choice. lbfgs can also work well.\n",
